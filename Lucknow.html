            <h2>Tradition and Customs of Lucknow</h2>
            <p>Lucknow is often acknowledged as the hub of traditions and customs. Lucknow’s “Mehmaan Nawazi” is a custom that the residents strictly follow and this custom has earned the city huge respect from the expats.

                The traditional Awadhi cuisine served in modern day Lucknow has a royal touch. The nawabs loved their food and encouraged their royal chefs to perfect the art of cooking. Though the Awadhi cuisine has an uncanny resemblance with the Mughlai dishes, the Nawabs succeeded in giving a touch of their individuality and distinctness. They introduced the Dum style of cooking, a tradition that is followed till date. People from different parts of the world visit Lucknow to get a taste of the mouth watering Awadhi dishes like korma, salan, kebabs, Lucknowi biryani, pulao and chaats.

            <h2>Cuisine</h2>
            <p>The Awadh region has its own distinct Nawabi-style cuisine. Since ages, the Bawarchis (chefs) and Rakabdars (royal chefs) have developed great finesse in cooking and presentation of food, under royal patronage. This gave rise to the art of cooking over a slow fire (or Dum style cooking), which has become synonymous with "Awadhi" cuisine. These Bawarchis added elaborately prepared dishes like kababs, kormas, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis and warqi parathas to the traditional "Awadhi" dastarkhwaan (feast of dishes).[169] The best-known dishes of this area consist of biryanis, kebabs and breads. Kebabs are served in a variety of styles; kakori, galawati, shami, boti, patili-ke, ghutwa and seekh are among the available varieties.[169] Tunde ke kabab restaurants are popular for a type of soft kebab developed by a one-armed chef (hence the name Tunday) for a Nawab who had lost his teeth.[170] The reputation of Lucknow's kebabs is not limited to the local population and the dish attracts people from other cities as well as other countries.[171]

                Lucknow is also known for its chaats, street food, kulfi, paan and sweets. Nahari, a dish prepared using mutton, is popular among non-vegetarians. Sheermal is a type of sweet bread (paratha) prepared in Lucknow. Makkhan-malai is another sweet delicacy of Lucknow made and sold only during winters. Some restaurants in the city are around a century old; there are also many high-end restaurants, bakeries, lounges and pubs which cater to the affluent class and foreign travellers.</p>

The first Lucknow Festival was staged as a part of this promotion and ever since, with some exceptions, Lucknow Mahotsava has taken place annually.[174]
